Description:
  Change your 'note'.

  A note is a short message displayed everytime someone sends a mail
  to you, or looks at your status.

Background:
  A 'note' was originally intended for informing other users mailing
  you that you (for example) is away somewhere and cannot answer their
  mail until next month.
