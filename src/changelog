	* survreport.c (argv): 

	* Fixed a bug in the file locking. Under SOLARIS files
	were not locked properly, which e.g. resulted in a loss of
	survey replies when two users took the same survey at
	the same time. Question mark remains as to whether the 
	file locking works under Linux.

	* Made some minor changes in the handling of the
	at command (for survey reports).

	* Added code in survreport.c to change ownership
	and group of survey reports.
	
Thu Jan  9 15:58:01 1997  Olof Runborg  <olofr@c2m2-12.nada.kth.se>

	* Version 1.28 released.

	* edit.c (mailrec;): Added help text for surveys.

	* survreport.c (argv): New separate program that
	reports surveys. Moved summary information report
	to this program. Handle survery reporting via at
	command.

	* During readsome and readall, users are not prompted
	for survey replies.

Sat Jan  4 20:30:41 1997  Olof Runborg  <olofr@c2m2-12.nada.kth.se>

	* sklaffadm.c (argv): Exclude surveys when the sklaffadm
	'purge' command is run. Surveys are not deleted.

	Earlier: 

	- Fixed a bug that crashed the system when very
	  long mail addresses were used.
	- Added the "result" command for displaying full
	  survey results (raw data).
	- Made survey reports in summary form, for the different
	  question types.

	* Ported SklaffKOM to Solaris systems.

	* Version 1.27, added surveys. New file: survey.c. Fixed
	a bug in edit.c; messages sent from within the editor were
	converted to lower case.

	* Reinvented the wheel. The cmd_answermsg() function didn't take
	into account that the found message could be one that you sent
	yourself. This I fixed in a version that I never released officially,
	so I can't blame anyone except myself. Anyways, here is 1.27.

Sun Dec 22 09:23:57 1996  Peter Lindberg  <peter@skom.skom.se>

	* Bunch of stuff added for surveys. Released as 1.26.

Sun Dec  8 17:35:54 1996  S|derKOM administration  <sklaff@skom.skom.se>

	* commands.c (cmd_read_last_text): Added this function which
	simply displays the 'last' read new text.

	* msg.c (display_msg): If the Presbeep flag is set, 'I' messages
	doesn't beep. This is due to a request from the impossible man,
	although the semantics for the flag is freaked out.
	Also made the list interruptible.

	* commands.c (cmd_answermsg): Fixed so that it answers to the
	right user, i.e. the one from which the LAST RECEIVED 'SAY' was
	from, not the last message regardless of type.

Sat Dec  7 21:20:37 1996  S|derKOM administration  <sklaff@skom.skom.se>

	* msg.c: Added a guard in list_mlist() so that max never is too
	high, which can cause enormous swapping.

	* Released versions 1.23 and 1.24. Added commands for displaying
	the last received and sent say/shout/I messages. Also extended
	the buffer so that it can 'remember' an unlimited number of
	messages. It makes the users happy.

Sun Nov 24 19:50:50 1996  S|derKOM administration  <sklaff@skom.skom.se>

	* Time to start all over. The old ChangeLog hadn't been updated
	for years. Anyway, I have now fixed the bug that made sklaff
	crash when requesting help for certain commands. Then I added
	the URL field in the user information and finally added the toy
	command "from". I also made some commands silent when used in
	the "login scripts".
